June 2023 Bits
======================

This page contains small entries about random technical stuff I have done throughout June 2023.

June 7 - Upload speed in Proxmox containers and VMs very poor
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Just struggled through watching a movie over my Plex.
Tried a speedtest on my older server, which is not running Proxmox.
Decent upload speed. Tried a speed test in a Windows VM and in an Ubuntu Docker container inside an LXC and got terrible results for the upload speed (3-4Mbps).
I used the `speedtest cli <https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli#ubuntu>`_ in Ubuntu and for the Windows VM I just used their website.

Someone had a `similar problem <https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/odd-network-behavior-on-vms-and-cts.54007/>`_.
Something about this happening specifically on Ubuntu installs.
There's also some talk of the fact that you should really `use an Intel NIC <https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/upload-speed-issue.54840/>`_,
but even that isn't a for sure cause of the problem.

The solution? Reboot my Proxmox host? No. Reboot my router. Yeah. That fixed it.

Unrelated but
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Would be cool to install this in my suite of web apps: https://hub.docker.com/r/openspeedtest/latest.
That is for running a speed test from your browser.
Another cool app is this: https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/e7db/speedtest/
which from what I can tell runs a speed test on the server that program is running on.

Would also be cool if I made a speed test based on ``ubuntu:latest`` and installed ``speedtest`` using `speedtest cli <https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli#ubuntu>`_.
I could publish it on ghcr.io .
