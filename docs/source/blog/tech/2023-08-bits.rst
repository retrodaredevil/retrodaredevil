August 2023 Bits
================


August 3 - Grafana 10 and the Infinity Datasource
---------------------------------------------------

Yesterday I installed Grafana 10 on my own server, hoping to understand it better before upgrading
the Wild Mountain Farms Grafana to that.
`Fifeman GraphQL Datasource <https://github.com/fifemon/graphql-datasource>`_ has served me well, but it's not maintained anymore.
I came across the `Infinity Datasource <https://sriramajeyam.com/grafana-infinity-datasource/>`_ recently, and it seems to do everything I need and more.
And even better, `it's maintained <https://github.com/yesoreyeram/grafana-infinity-datasource>`_ (last commit 10 hours ago as I write this)!
I got it up and working like so:

Now I just have to figure how to use Grafana's Group By feature, since (unlike GraphQL Datasource), Infinity does not support Group By natively.

(Update August 4). Alright so I played with it a bit... and... yeah I can't seem to figure out how the fuck it's supposed to work.
But luckily, the plugin itself supports `UQL (Unstructured Query Language) <https://github.com/yesoreyeram/uql>`_,
which is a project that is way too cool looking to only have 5 stars (okay 6 now that I starred it).
It even has some `great docs <https://sriramajeyam.com/grafana-infinity-datasource/wiki/uql/>`_ (on the Infinity's plugin docs).
It's made by the same person!
Alright, it seems really cool, but I don't think it can convince Grafana to make it into separate series.
Maybe there's something I'm missing.
Changing the parser to "Backend" is interesting, but I can't seem to get its summarize/summarize by to work
(And I don't really know how to use them).
There's also the `GROQ <https://www.sanity.io/docs/groq>`_ option, but I suspect that I'll run into the same problem,
It has a nice `cheat sheet <https://www.sanity.io/docs/query-cheat-sheet>`_ and it has a cool `GROQ Arcade <https://groq.dev/>`_.
Looking at the documentation, GROQ seems extremely powerful for altering JSON data, but I don't think it'll work.

(Update August 5) I ended up spending a lot of time looking into GROQ anyway.
I had problems trying to search the documentation and tutorials for dealing with nested JSON.
I even ran across `this tutorial <https://css-tricks.com/query-json-documents-in-the-terminal-with-groq/>`_ and I couldn't even get its example to work in GROQ Arcade.

I just looked into Grafana transformations a bit more and I was searching among transformations and finally found
the `partition by values <https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/panels-visualizations/query-transform-data/transform-data/#partition-by-values>`_ transformation.
It does exactly what I need!!
All I have to do is select "Representation" as the field to partition by and it works!
Now the labels on each line on the graph are called "Battery Voltage <device>".
I can use a `rename by regex <https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/panels-visualizations/query-transform-data/transform-data/#rename-by-regex>`_ transformation.
I set match to ``^Battery Voltage (.*)`` and replace to ``$1``.
