October 7 - Installing OS
-------------------------

I'm installing Pop!_OS on a new laptop.
I want my drive to be encrypted, so I had to do the clean install, which wiped my disk completely but setup encryption.
Now after the install I can resize it to my liking!
I found a tutorial (https://mutschler.dev/linux/pop-os-btrfs-22-04/) which does some more advanced stuff than I needed, but it looks helpful.

Turns out, that tutorial is doing wayy more than I need.
I opted to stick with the clean install of Pop!_OS, but decrypting (almost) the entire SSD whenever my computer boots up took literal minutes.
I don't feel like it should take that long, but even if it took 30 seconds, that would not be something I want to put up with.
Alright. Let's do this install again.

I could do a clean (unencrypted) install, but now that there's no downside to doing a manual install, I will opt for that.
Now that I see what sizes the default install gave partitions, I will note them here

* Boot: 1022 MiB
* recovery: 4 GiB
* Encrypted root: 944.87 GiB
* Swap: 4 GiB

I'll keep the boot and recovery drives (although I'll still check the reformat box). I'll create a root partition that's pretty big.
I'll create the swap, and I'll go ahead and create an unused ext4 partition that I will encrypt later.
The leftover unused space will be used for a Windows install.

Now that everything is working in my Pop!_OS install, it's time to create bootable Windows media.
I'm going to use `WoeUSB <https://github.com/WoeUSB/WoeUSB/releases/tag/v5.2.4>`_ for this.
I try running it, and it complains about ``wimlib-imagex`` not being available in the path.
A ``sudo apt install wimtools`` does the trick to fix the problem.
Now I make sure my USB drive is ``/dev/sda`` and then run ``sudo bash Downloads/woeusb-5.2.4.bash --device Downloads/Win11_22H2_English_x64v2.iso /dev/sda``.

Git Signing Key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I have git version 2.34.1, so that means I can use my SSH key as my signing key if I would like.
Normally, my ``.gitconfig`` looks like this:

.. code-block::

  [user]
    name = Lavender Shannon
    signingkey = E274ED307902B127
  [includeIf "gitdir/i:~/programming/"]
    path = ~/programming/.gitconfig-default
  [includeIf "gitdir:~/programming/.git/modules/Mst/"]
    path = ~/programming/Mst/.gitconfig-mst

  [filter "lfs"]
    clean = git-lfs clean -- %f
    smudge = git-lfs smudge -- %f
    process = git-lfs filter-process
    required = true

  [commit]
    gpgSign = true
  [tag]
    gpgSign = true

However, now I can instead follow this tutorial: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/telling-git-about-your-signing-key

.. code-block:: shell

  git config --global gpg.format ssh
  git config --global user.signingkey /home/lavender/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Now my ``.gitconfig`` looks like this:

.. code-block::


  [user]
    name = Lavender Shannon
    signingkey = /home/lavender/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  [gpg]
    format = ssh

  [includeIf "gitdir/i:~/programming/"]
    path = ~/programming/.gitconfig-default
  [includeIf "gitdir:~/programming/.git/modules/Mst/"]
    path = ~/programming/Mst/.gitconfig-mst

  [filter "lfs"]
    clean = git-lfs clean -- %f
    smudge = git-lfs smudge -- %f
    process = git-lfs filter-process
    required = true

  [commit]
    gpgSign = true
  [tag]
    gpgSign = true

Perfect! That was super easy! Now I make sure to add the key to my GitHub (and school GitLab) as a signing key.

If I make a commit and then run ``git log --show-signature``, I get an error message of ``error: gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile needs to be configured and exist for ssh signature verification``.
`This tutorial <https://blog.dbrgn.ch/2021/11/16/git-ssh-signatures/>`_ recommends that I create a file in ``~/.config/git/allowed_signers``.
I think I'll version control this file in my own location.
My ``allowed_signers`` file now looks like this:

.. code-block::

  retrodaredevil@gmail.com ssh-rsa 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 lavender@lavender-legion

It's just the public key with an email before it. Simple enough!

Windows Setup
---------------

I setup Windows 11 with a local account by attempting to sign in with the email no@thankyou.com. I was surprised at how well that worked.

* Install

  * Firefox: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/
  * WinGet: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/

    * https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NBLGGH4NNS1?hl=en-us&gl=US
    * winget repository: https://winstall.app
    * (Was already installed, just needed to be updated)

  * Git & Git Bash: https://git-scm.com/downloads

    * (In powershell) ``winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget``
    * This does the default install, which is fine for me because it installs Git Bash too, and that's all I need

  * In Git bash:

    * ``winget install powertoys --source msstore``
    * ``winget install --id=Valve.Steam -e``
    * ``winget install --id=JetBrains.Toolbox -e``
    * ``winget install --id=EpicGames.EpicGamesLauncher -e``
    * ``winget install --id=OpenWhisperSystems.Signal -e``
    * ``winget install --id=Discord.Discord -e``
    * ``winget install --id=Mojang.MinecraftLauncher -e``
    * ``winget install --id=Plex.Plexamp -e``

  * Find my drivers: https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx?lang=en-us

    * Restart PC after doing this
    * Go to System > Display > Advanced display

      * Confirm internal display is at 240Hz

* Remap caps lock

  * PowerToys Settings > Keyboard Manager > Remap a key

* Make Minecraft use GPU

  * System > Display > Graphics
  * Add an app, find ``javaw`` in the Minecraft Launcher program files
  * javaw > Graphics preference > High performance

* Turn off tap to click

  * Settings -> Bluetooth and Devices -> Touchpad -> Taps - Turn all off

* IntelliJ

  * Set terminal to Git Bash

    * Settings -> Tools -> Terminal

``.gitconfig`` in Windows
----------------------------

It's fairly similar to how I did it on linux, it's just slightly different.

.. code-block::

  [user]
    name = Lavender Shannon
    signingkey = /c/Users/lavender/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  [gpg]
    format = ssh

  [includeIf "gitdir/i:~/programming/"]
    path = ~/programming/.gitconfig-default
  [includeIf "gitdir:~/programming/.git/modules/Mst/"]
    path = ~/programming/Mst/.gitconfig-mst

  [filter "lfs"]
    clean = git-lfs clean -- %f
    smudge = git-lfs smudge -- %f
    process = git-lfs filter-process
    required = true

  [commit]
    gpgSign = true
  [tag]
    gpgSign = true

Laggy External Display in Pop!_OS
------------------------------------

My external display is quite a bit more laggy than my internal one.
I'm running NVIDIA Graphics, but let's try hybrid mode (even though people seem to think that causes issues).
Hybrid graphics doesn't seem to change anything, but if I open NVIDIA Settings > GPU 0 > PowerMizer and set Preferred Mode to Maximum, it works!
(Thanks https://github.com/pop-os/pop/issues/2747#issuecomment-1371025332)

Screenshots in Pop!_OS
---------------------------

I'll be using the Print key to start to make my selection, then I save it and it shows up in recents.
I'll still have to play around with this.

Monitor Scaling in Pop!_OS

Lessons Learned in Buying this Laptop
---------------------------------------

* Don't get an NVIDIA GPU (Getting it to be not glitchy on Linux is a pain)
* Make sure there are some thunderbolt USB C ports. Also understand how a display connected via USB C interacts with the graphics card
* Understand if the HDMI port requires the GPU to be used

October 9 - About the NVIDIA graphics
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Hybrid mode is worse than NVIDIA Graphics for external monitors.
Don't use hybrid mode unless you don't plan on using an external monitor.

Here is the output of ``inxi -G`` when selecting Hybrid Graphics in Pop!_OS.
I believe it actually ends up being the same as when using NVIDIA Graphics mode.

.. code-block:: console

  lavender@lavender-legion:~$ inxi -G
  Graphics:
    Device-1: Intel driver: i915 v: kernel
    Device-2: NVIDIA driver: nvidia v: 535.113.01
    Device-3: Luxvisions Innotech Integrated Camera type: USB
      driver: uvcvideo
    Display: x11 server: X.Org v: 1.21.1.4 driver: X:
      loaded: modesetting,nvidia unloaded: fbdev,nouveau,vesa gpu: i915
      resolution: 1: 1920x1080~60Hz 2: 2560x1600~240Hz
    OpenGL: renderer: Mesa Intel Graphics (RPL-S)
      v: 4.6 Mesa 23.1.3-1pop0~1689084530~22.04~0618746

Here is the correct output of ``nvidia-smi`` indicating that things are using the GPU:


.. code-block:: console

Notice specifically that ``/usr/lib/xorg/Xorg`` is using more than 10MiB of memory.
If it is using something like 4MiB of memory, then it's not really using the GPU at all.

Enable Hybernation in Pop!_OS
-------------------------------------

At some point, I'll run through this tutorial: https://support.system76.com/articles/enable-hibernation/
