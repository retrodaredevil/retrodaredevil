July 2024 Setting Up VyOS as a Router
========================================

June 30 - Building VyOS
-------------------------

.. note::

  Building the rolling release VyOS image is not strictly necessary because VyOS actually provides those images.

`VyOS <https://github.com/vyos/vyos-build>`_ is router software I want to try out.
I will use https://docs.vyos.io/en/latest/contributing/build-vyos.html to help me build it.

I run these commands:

.. code-block:: shell

  docker pull vyos/vyos-build:current
  git clone -b current --single-branch https://github.com/vyos/vyos-build
  cd vyos-build
  docker run --rm -it --privileged -v $(pwd):/vyos -w /vyos vyos/vyos-build:current bash

From the container's bash shell:

.. code-block:: shell

  cd vyos-build
  # you are now inside of /vyos/vyos-build
  sudo make clean
  sudo ./build-vyos-image generic --architecture amd64 --build-by "j.randomhacker@vyos.io"

At the time of writing, 1.5 is not out yet, so ``vyos-build/build/vyos-1.5-rolling-202406301547-generic-amd64.iso`` is the image that is built.

`Running on Proxmox <https://docs.vyos.io/en/latest/installation/virtual/proxmox.html>`_ has documentation for running on Proxmox.
I parse the command ``qm create 200 --name vyos --memory 2048 --net0 virtio,bridge=vmbr0 --ide2 media=cdrom,file=local:iso/live-image-amd64.hybrid.iso --virtio0 local-lvm:15``
and see that it wants 2GB RAM, and 15GB of storage.

I tried giving it 4 cores, which resulted in 16 vCPUs, while my CPU only supports 12 (or 3 cores) (``TASK ERROR: MAX 12 vcpus allowed per VM on this node``).
I don't usually create VMs often, so this is different from being able to choose between 1 and 12 CPUs.
1 core and 1 socket is probably enough.

I let it boot into to the installer (KVM console), login with ``vyos/vyos``, and then run ``install image``.
I choose defaults, then shutdown the VM when it's done.
I then remove the installation media and start the VM back up.

Now I can follow the `Quick Start <https://docs.vyos.io/en/latest/quick-start.html>`_.

Before I get into configuring, my set up, I want to understand how I want to set this up long term.
I will eventually want to configure this `using Ansible <https://docs.vyos.io/en/latest/configexamples/ansible.html>`_.
To do that, I first need to be able to access VyOS via SSH.
The quick start covers this in `Hardening <https://docs.vyos.io/en/latest/quick-start.html#hardening>`_.
We're going to come back to this once I actually have SSH access set up, and more importantly, being able to ping the thing itself!

July 13 - Configuring VyOS and Proxmox Network Interfaces
-----------------------------------------------------------

Before we do this configuration, you'll probably want to be able to "copy paste".
Well, this is almost as good. We're going to mount a drive to Proxmox, and then mount that drive in VyOS.

First create a Hard Disk with a size of 1GB in the VyOS VM hardware configuration inside Proxmox.
Then run these commands in the PVE shell.

.. code-block:: shell

  # In Proxmox
  # NOTE make sure you get the `/dev/pve/vm-204-disk-1` right to correspond to your hard disk
  mkfs.ext4 /dev/pve/vm-204-disk-1
  mkdir /mnt/vm204disk1
  mount /dev/pve/vm-204-disk-1 /mnt/vm204disk1


Let's do some simple configuration now...

.. code-block:: shell

  configure

  set interfaces ethernet eth0 address dhcp
  set interfaces ethernet eth0 description 'OUTSIDE'
  set interfaces ethernet eth1 address '192.168.44.1/24'
  set interfaces ethernet eth1 description 'LAN'


  set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN subnet 192.168.44.0/24 option default-router '192.168.44.1'
  set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN subnet 192.168.44.0/24 option name-server '192.168.44.1'
  set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN subnet 192.168.44.0/24 option domain-name 'vyos.net'
  set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN subnet 192.168.44.0/24 lease '86400'
  set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN subnet 192.168.44.0/24 range 0 start '192.168.44.100'
  set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN subnet 192.168.44.0/24 range 0 stop '192.168.44.189'
  set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN subnet 192.168.44.0/24 subnet-id '1'

  set service dns forwarding cache-size '0'
  set service dns forwarding listen-address '192.168.44.1'
  set service dns forwarding allow-from '192.168.44.0/24'

  set nat source rule 100 outbound-interface name 'eth0'
  set nat source rule 100 source address '192.168.44.0/24'
  set nat source rule 100 translation address masquerade

Now to configure the firewall (https://docs.vyos.io/en/latest/quick-start.html#firewall)

.. code-block:: shell

  set firewall group interface-group WAN interface eth0
  set firewall group interface-group LAN interface eth1
  set firewall group network-group NET-INSIDE-v4 network '192.168.44.0/24'



  # We do option 1
  set firewall global-options state-policy established action accept
  set firewall global-options state-policy related action accept
  set firewall global-options state-policy invalid action drop



  # block incoming traffic
  set firewall ipv4 name OUTSIDE-IN default-action 'drop'

  set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule 100 action jump
  set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule 100 jump-target OUTSIDE-IN
  set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule 100 inbound-interface group WAN
  set firewall ipv4 forward filter rule 100 destination group network-group NET-INSIDE-v4
  # By default, block traffic to router that isn't explicitly allowed
  set firewall ipv4 input filter default-action 'drop'



  # Allow management access (allowing SSH)
  set firewall ipv4 name VyOS_MANAGEMENT default-action 'return'


  set firewall ipv4 input filter rule 20 action jump
  set firewall ipv4 input filter rule 20 jump-target VyOS_MANAGEMENT
  set firewall ipv4 input filter rule 20 destination port 22
  set firewall ipv4 input filter rule 20 protocol tcp


  set firewall ipv4 name VyOS_MANAGEMENT rule 15 action 'accept'
  set firewall ipv4 name VyOS_MANAGEMENT rule 15 inbound-interface group 'LAN'

  set firewall ipv4 name VyOS_MANAGEMENT rule 20 action 'drop'
  set firewall ipv4 name VyOS_MANAGEMENT rule 20 recent count 4
  set firewall ipv4 name VyOS_MANAGEMENT rule 20 recent time minute
  set firewall ipv4 name VyOS_MANAGEMENT rule 20 state new
  set firewall ipv4 name VyOS_MANAGEMENT rule 20 inbound-interface group 'WAN'

  set firewall ipv4 name VyOS_MANAGEMENT rule 21 action 'accept'
  set firewall ipv4 name VyOS_MANAGEMENT rule 21 state new
  set firewall ipv4 name VyOS_MANAGEMENT rule 21 inbound-interface group 'WAN'



  # Allow Access to services
  set firewall ipv4 input filter rule 30 action 'accept'
  set firewall ipv4 input filter rule 30 icmp type-name 'echo-request'
  set firewall ipv4 input filter rule 30 protocol 'icmp'
  set firewall ipv4 input filter rule 30 state new

  set firewall ipv4 input filter rule 40 action 'accept'
  set firewall ipv4 input filter rule 40 destination port '53'
  set firewall ipv4 input filter rule 40 protocol 'tcp_udp'
  set firewall ipv4 input filter rule 40 source group network-group NET-INSIDE-v4


  set firewall ipv4 input filter rule 50 action 'accept'
  set firewall ipv4 input filter rule 50 source address 127.0.0.0/8

Put as much of that as you want to use in a file in the drive you just mounted,
and then unmount the drive like so:

.. code-block:: shell

  # In Proxmox
  umount /mnt/vm204disk1
  # Deactivate the logical volume (note that your VM might need to be shut down for this to work)
  lvchange -an /dev/pve/vm-204-disk-1

Now, within the VM, we need to mount that drive.

.. code-block:: shell

  # In VyOS
  sudo mkdir /mnt/tempdisk
  # NOTE: verify /dev/sdb is correct by running `lsblk`
  sudo mount /dev/sdb /mnt/newdisk

You can copy that file over and run it after making sure you're in ``configure`` mode like this:

.. code-block:: shell

  . ./initial_config.sh

I'm going to come back to `Hardening <https://docs.vyos.io/en/latest/quick-start.html#hardening>`_ later.
For now, we can commit and save:

.. code-block:: shell

  commit
  save

Now, you should get an error message saying that ``Interface "eth1" does not exist!``.
Let's create that now.

In Proxmox, I'm going to set my ``/etc/network/interfaces`` to be this:

.. code-block::

  # network interface settings; autogenerated
  # Please do NOT modify this file directly, unless you know what
  # you're doing.
  #
  # If you want to manage parts of the network configuration manually,
  # please utilize the 'source' or 'source-directory' directives to do
  # so.
  # PVE will preserve these directives, but will NOT read its network
  # configuration from sourced files, so do not attempt to move any of
  # the PVE managed interfaces into external files!

  auto lo
  iface lo inet loopback

  iface eno1 inet manual
  # eno1 is the built-in Ethernet port, and will be configured as a debug port below

  iface enpxleftbottom inet manual
  # enpxleftbottom  is the left (looking from the back) bottom Ethernet port - vmbr2wan  WAN

  iface enpxlefttop inet manual
  # enpxlefttop     is the left (looking from the back) top    Ethernet port - vmbr3lan1 LAN1

  iface enpxrightbottom inet manual
  # enpxrightbottom is the right(looking from the back) bottom Ethernet port - vmbr4lan2 LAN2

  iface enpxrighttop inet manual
  # enpxrighttop    is the right(looking from the back) top    Ethernet port - vmbr5lan3 LAN3

  auto vmbr0
  iface vmbr0 inet static
    address 192.168.44.20/24
    # NOTE: Uncomment gateway when you want this to be used for routing Proxmox's internet traffic
    #gateway 192.168.44.1
    dns-nameservers 1.1.1.1
    bridge-ports none
    bridge-stp off
    bridge-fd 0
  #internal LAN. All VMs and containers should default to this.

  auto vmbr1debug
  iface vmbr1debug inet dhcp
    bridge-ports eno1
    bridge-stp off
    bridge-fd 0
  #debug Proxmox port


  auto vmbr2wan
  iface vmbr2wan inet manual
    bridge-ports enpxleftbottom
    bridge-stp off
    bridge-fd 0
  #PCIe slot 0 Ethernet 0 - WAN port

  auto vmbr3lan1
  iface vmbr3lan1 inet manual
    bridge-ports enpxlefttop
    bridge-stp off
    bridge-fd 0
  #PCIe slot 0 Ethernet 1 - LAN1 port

  auto vmbr4lan2
  iface vmbr4lan2 inet manual
    bridge-ports enpxrightbottom
    bridge-stp off
    bridge-fd 0
  #PCIe slot 1 Ethernet 0 - LAN2 port


  auto vmbr5lan3
  iface vmbr5lan3 inet manual
    bridge-ports enpxrighttop
    bridge-stp off
    bridge-fd 0
  #PCIe slot 0 Ethernet 1 - LAN1 port


Notice that vmbr1debug uses dhcp to get its IP address.
This means that I should be able to plug the built-in Ethernet to some router's LAN and get access to it on that network
if I ever screw anything up.

.. note::

  For reference: https://wiki.debian.org/BridgeNetworkConnections

Now, those physical interfaces I referred to actually need to be setup correctly by creating some persistent rules.
Edit ``/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules``

.. code-block:: shell

  SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", ATTR{address}=="a0:36:9f:09:51:66", NAME="enpxleftbottom"
  SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", ATTR{address}=="a0:36:9f:09:51:67", NAME="enpxlefttop"
  SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", ATTR{address}=="1c:86:0b:22:57:e6", NAME="enpxrightbottom"
  SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", ATTR{address}=="1c:86:0b:22:57:e7", NAME="enpxrighttop"

I made up this ``enpx...`` naming convention, but it's somewhat similar to the default naming convention.
After a reboot, you should see (kernel) log messages such as these in ``journalctl --since=today``:

.. code-block::

  igb 0000:03:00.0 enpxleftbottom: renamed from enp3s0f0
  igb 0000:03:00.1 enpxlefttop: renamed from enp3s0f1
  igb 0000:01:00.0 enpxrightbottom: renamed from enp1s0f0
