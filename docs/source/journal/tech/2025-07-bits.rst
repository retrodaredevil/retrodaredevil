July 10 - Armbian Setup on Orange Pi One
--------------------------------------------------

I have an Orange Pi One.
I installed Armbian.

I logged in with root:1234, choose en_US-UTF-8.
I attempted to set up the WiFi by putting the SD card in my computer and configuring stuff like wpa_supplicant,
but no luck.

I ended up configuring it manually and this is what ``/etc/netplan/armbian.conf`` contained afterwards

.. code-block:: yaml

  network:
    version: 2
    renderer: networkd
    wifis:
      wlx000f6009be25:
        dhcp4: true
        dhcp6: true
        macaddress: "00:0f:60:09:be:25"
        access-points:
          "WiFi_2GHz":
            auth:
              key-management: "psk"
              password: "mypassword"

I of course used

.. code-block::

  sudo apt install -y sudo vim git tmux less curl wget make stow net-tools iputils-tracepath traceroute netcat-openbsd tree man-db file htop gpg-agent rsync pwgen

to install some stuff, and then I installed docker https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/

.. code-block::

  sudo usermod -aG docker lavender


.. code-block::

  ssh-keygen -t ed25519
  # Now set up lavender-config stuff :)

Now to do led stuff.
diozero does not support PWM control, so we use SPI.

.. code-block::

  sudo apt install git build-essential
  echo "overlays=spi-spidev" | sudo tee /boot/armbianEnv.txt
  echo "param_spidev_spi_bus=0" | sudo tee /boot/armbianEnv.txt

.. code-block::

  sudo apt install wireguard

I rebooted and now the system is screwed up.

I tried replacing ``rootdev=UUID=fe68f99c-61aa-4ebd-b02a-d5cda2484d77`` line with ``rootdev=/dev/mmcblk0p1``
in ``armbianEnv.txt``.
Did not work.

Ok.
I'm giving up.
Maybe my SD card is corrupted, but honestly this Orange Pi One isn't worth the hassle it has caused me.
