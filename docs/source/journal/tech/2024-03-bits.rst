March 23 - ZFS Error
-----------------------

I got a ZFS error. Documenting it here:

.. code-block:: console

  root@bigger-fish:~# zpool status -v manta
    pool: manta
   state: ONLINE
  status: One or more devices has experienced an error resulting in data
    corruption.  Applications may be affected.
  action: Restore the file in question if possible.  Otherwise restore the
    entire pool from backup.

  errors: Permanent errors have been detected in the following files:

          /manta/subvol-100-disk-0/media/public/movies/The Darkest Minds (2018)/The.Darkest.Minds.2018.1080p.BluRay.x264-[YTS.AM].mp4

After deleting the file, it is replaced with ``manta/subvol-100-disk-0:<0x1ea>``.

Now I run a ``zpool scrub manta``.
The command completes, but the scrub is still in progress.
I can see the progress by running ``zpool status -v manta``.

After a while:

.. code-block:: console

  root@bigger-fish:~# zpool status -v manta
    pool: manta
   state: ONLINE
  status: Some supported and requested features are not enabled on the pool.
    The pool can still be used, but some features are unavailable.
  action: Enable all features using 'zpool upgrade'. Once this is done,
    the pool may no longer be accessible by software that does not support
    the features. See zpool-features(7) for details.
