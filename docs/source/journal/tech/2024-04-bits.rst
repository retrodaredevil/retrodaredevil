April 2024 Bits
===============


April 7 - DNS Server
----------------------

I've tried out Pihole and Adguard Home before, but I want something that's a little bit easier to understand and backup configuration for.
I'm looking at a few options:

* https://technitium.com/dns/

  * Uses a Web UI for configuration

* https://github.com/0xERR0R/blocky

  * Grafana dashboard: https://github.com/0xERR0R/blocky-grafana-prometheus-example
  * Supports DNS over HTTPS server
  * Blocking can be temporarily disabled via CLI: https://0xerr0r.github.io/blocky/v0.23/interfaces/

* https://github.com/Cottand/leng

  * A comparison: https://cottand.github.io/leng/AlternativesComparison.html
  * Supports DNS over HTTPS server
  * No premade Grafana dashboard, but has metrics: https://cottand.github.io/leng/Prometheus-Metrics.html

Both blocky and leng use a config file for configuration, but blocky seems to have a way to disable ad blocking temporarily,
which is a requirement.

There's also now a Hacker News thread on this: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39968103
Some of the comments mention using https://oisd.nl/ as the blocklist, as that seems to break the least number of things.


April 8 - Downgrade NVIDIA Drivers
-----------------------------------

Well, I did it again: I upgraded my NVIDIA drivers.
Big mistake. Huge.

I'm currently running 550.67, and I think I will downgrade to the latest 535 driver: 535.161.07.
I had 535.113.01 installed a while back, and that worked great, which is why I want to stick with the 535 series.

I will follow this:

.. code-block:: shell

  sudo apt purge ~nnvidia
  sudo apt install nvidia-driver-535-server

Might as well enable Wayland support while we're at it

.. code-block:: shell

  echo 'options nvidia_drm modeset=1' | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/zz-nvidia-modeset.conf
  sudo vi /etc/gdm3/custom.conf  # enable wayland

Now ``flatpak update && sudo reboot``.

The most important thing that we've done is remove ``system76-driver-nvidia``,
which seems to automatically update the NVIDIA fairly frequently.

As I expected, 535.161.07 is now installed!

.. code-block::

It's good to finally be back on stable NVIDIA drivers.
Now I don't have to unplug my third monitor before suspending my computer (545 and 550),
and unplugging my monitor and plugging it back in no longer causes the system to only support extremely basic graphics (550).

Update (April 10): It seems that sometimes after plugging external monitors back in, my refresh rates get locked at 60 and fractional scaling does not work.
We'll have to see if this continues, but I didn't expect this to happen since the last time I used a 535 driver it worked about as perfectly as I could ask for.

April 10 - Choosing an apcupsd prometheus exporter
-----------------------------------------------------

I documented installing apcupsd a while ago (:ref:`2023-08-14-apcupsd`).
However, I have not been collecting metrics any of this time.
Now that I have a decent Prometheus setup going, it makes sense to collect metrics from this.

I have a few options:

* https://github.com/jirutka/apcupsd-snmp + https://github.com/prometheus/snmp_exporter + https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12340-ups/

  * Fairly outdated

* https://github.com/3VLINC/apcupsd-prometheus

  * Updated June 8, 2023
  * Supports docker - published on Docker Hub
  * Written in JavaScript

* https://github.com/io-developer/prom-apcupsd-exporter

  * Updated February 5, 2024
  * Supports docker - published on Docker Hub
  * Written in Go

* https://github.com/mdlayher/apcupsd_exporter

  * Updated March 14, 2022
  * No docker support

    * Third party support: https://hub.docker.com/r/jangrewe/apcupsd-exporter

  * Written in Go
  * https://brendonmatheson.com/2020/02/20/monitoring-apc-ups-units-with-prometheus-on-raspberry-pi.html

* https://github.com/damomurf/apcupsd-exporter + https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/13525-apc-ups/

  * Updated May 19, 2019
  * No docker support
  * Written in Go

If I wasn't running Proxmox, I would probably choose whichever one has the best docker support,
but figuring out which one to choose might be difficult now as I don't have docker installed inside of Proxmox.
I'll have to think on it.

Additionally, I want to eventually look into these things for monitoring Proxmox:

April 12 - A domain for my internal services
----------------------------------------------

I'm planning on self-hosting some applications on my laptop,
and I want to access them via a domain name and a self-signed certificate.
The domain I use will have to not be in use by anything else, so it's best I find a top level domain I can use.

* https://www.icann.org/en/public-comment/proceeding/proposed-top-level-domain-string-for-private-use-24-01-2024

  * Recommends the use of ``.internal``

* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8375

  * Describes the use of ``home.arpa``.
