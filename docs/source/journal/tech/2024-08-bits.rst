August 2024 Bits
==================


August 4 - Using K3b to rip CDs
--------------------------------

K3b can be used to rip CDs!
Here's "Ripped files pattern" I use:

.. code-block::

  %{albumartist}/%{albumtitle}/%{number} - %{title}

August 4 - Audacity Setup
---------------------------

I find that using Audacity in Flatpak is great, but takes a little bit for it to start up.
When using the system installed Audacity, you might have to set up a few things.

Open MP3 files correctly:

* https://forum.audacityteam.org/t/mp3-decoding-failed-lost-sychronization/57976
* Go to Edit > Preferences > Import / Export > Extended Import

  * Create a new rule that targets the file extensions ``*.mp3`` and move ``FFmpeg-compatible files`` to the top.

In the end, I ended up not using the system installed Audacity because I couldn't easily drag to move audio clips
like I could do in my Flatpak installed version. Maybe I have an older version. Oh well...

August 4 - Playing Audio CDs
-----------------------------------------

With ``mplayer``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

mplayer (``apt install -y mplayer``) is a great way to play CDs via the command line.
It gets out of your way pretty nicely, but skipping to a certain point in a track isn't easy.

.. code-block::

  mplayer -cdrom-device /dev/cdrom  cdda:// -cache 5000

With VLC
^^^^^^^^^

VLC is OK at playing CDs, as long as you open the media in Media > Open Media > Disc and manually enter the path to your CD (usually ``/dev/cdrom``).
The main problem with VLC is that it doesn't have gapless playback: https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc/-/merge_requests/94

With Rhythmbox
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rhythmbox is better than VLC at playing CDs.
To get truely gapless playback, you need to go into preferences and enable "Crossfade between tracks",
then set the duration to 0.0 seconds (which means there won't actually be a crossfade).
There is still a noticeable glitch between tracks, but it's better than VLC.

With cmus
^^^^^^^^^^

Install cmus, launch it, then run ``:add cdda://``. You'll have to wait a while for it to load tracks.

With DeaDBeeF Player
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

https://deadbeef.sourceforge.io/download.html

This option worked the best out of the box.
It had gapless playback without any fiddling.

Don't use
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* https://apps.kde.org/dragonplayer/ - no gapless playback, although it has a simple interface.
* https://flathub.org/apps/info.smplayer.SMPlayer - easiest way to install is Flatpak, and I couldn't get it to easily see my CD and play it.
* https://cmus.github.io While it's a nice command line UI (with VI like bindings). It's not intuitive, and does not load CDs quickly.

Conclusion
^^^^^^^^^^^

I might eventually try mpd, which has many, many options.
It's stupid that so many players

August 8 - Playing Surround Sound
------------------------------------

Plexamp does not seem to support playing flac files encoded for a 5.1 system.
However, you can configure VLC to play 5.1 files:

Tools > Preferences > Show settings = All > Audio > Output Modules > ALSA > Audio output channels = Surround 5.1

Sources on Plexamp being terrible at multi channel audio:

Finding Surround Sound Albums
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Playing surround sound is one thing, but finding albums that are released with surround sound are another.
Some artists released SACDs long before Blu-rays were a thing.
And now, it seems that for some albums, the only way to hear their 5.1 version is to subscribe to
Apple Music, Tidal, or Amazon Music.

When an album gets a Blu-ray release, it's usually done by

August 9 - Thinking about a DSL for controlling LEDs
-----------------------------------------------------

My project, `led-machine-plus <https://github.com/retrodaredevil/led-machine-plus>`_ has a janky, but powerful language
you use to control the patterns of LEDs.
Take this pattern:

.. code-block::

  (pixel #000 #512 #000 #936 #000 #512 #000 stop) 22 twinkle crawl

This is the one line version of this:

.. code-block::

  pixel #000 #512 #000 #936 #000 #512 #000
  stop
  22 twinkle
  pattern crawl

(Although it's worth noting that the one line version behaves differently if you were to try to set the global pattern,
but that's besides the point for the moment).

The current language is powerful, but also not as strict as a normal programming language or DSL.
My SolarThing project has a DSL called NotationScript with an implementation called ActionScript.
NotationScript itself is a DSL designed to be compiled to JSON in a very specific way.
If we were to think of an "LEDLang" implementation, it could express things in ways such as this:

.. code-block::

  twinkle(speed=crawl) : pixel(speed=stop) {
    #000
    #512
    #000
    #936
    #000
    #512
    #000
  }

At the time of writing, I would guess that NotationScript currently would not like the use of ``#000``,
but that can be fixed later.

Let's define some gradients

.. code-block::

  blend(speed=slow) {
    red
    green
    blue
  }
