3DS Modding
===============

I have my New 3DS modded. This page contains some information about it.


Things to Install
-------------------

From Universal Updater
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* "Shut The Cam Up" - removes shutter sound
* "Video_player_for_3DS.cia" - https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/Video_player_3DS

  * Press "X" to select a video file from SD card


Homebrew Games
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* https://github.com/mkst/sm64-port - Super Mario 64 Port

  * You must compile it yourself, but it has easy to follow instructions to do so!
