Simutrans Server
==================

`Simutrans <https://www.simutrans.com/en/>`_ is a free game similar to OpenTTD.
You can download it on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/434520/Simutrans/.
Official documentation about its multiplayer can be found here: https://www.simutrans.com/en/about/#multiplayer.

When in your client for the first time, I recommand making these changes:

* Floppy Disk > Map > Toggle Off "Day and Night cycle"
