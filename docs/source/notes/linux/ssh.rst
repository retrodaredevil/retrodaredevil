SSH
=====

SSH is awesome! It's useful for so many things! This page aims to document some of them, and how I use them.

Authorizing Users
--------------------

To authorize someone to log in to your machine, one would typically use the ``$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys`` file.
You can find out more about this file here: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.4.0?topic=daemon-format-authorized-keys-file

SSH Tunnels
------------

There are many ways to use tunnels. This blog post describes it very well: https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/ssh-tunnels/.
