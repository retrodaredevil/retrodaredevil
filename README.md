### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My biggest project is [SolarThing](https://github.com/wildmountainfarms/solarthing) (Java), which monitors a solar power system. I'm also involved in robotics. The [robot2020](https://github.com/frc1444/robot2020) (Java) and [robo-sim](https://github.com/frc1444/robo-sim) (Kotlin) are great examples of code I've written for a 120 pound robot. I have some web development experience using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. [TBA Scouting](https://github.com/retrodaredevil/tba-scouting) is a great example of this and so is [SolarThing Web](https://github.com/wildmountainfarms/solarthing-web). I've published [Track Shooter](https://github.com/retrodaredevil/track-shooter) on the Google Play Store. I also have some Android experience with [SolarThing Android](https://github.com/wildmountainfarms/solarthing-android) (Kotlin).
